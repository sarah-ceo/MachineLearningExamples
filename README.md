# MachineLearningExamples
Some examples of machine learning and deep learning algorithms made for an introduction to Machine Learning. 
Namely: 
<li> a supervised example on the Titanic dataset using a Decision Tree, a Random Forest, a Perceptron and a Neural Network;</li> 
<li> an unsupervised example on the MNIST dataset combining a K-Means algorithm with a Convolutional AutoEncoder;</li> 
<li> a reinforcement example on a simple environment using Q-Learning;</li>
